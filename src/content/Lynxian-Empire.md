Born in the fires of war, tempered by political turmoil, and struck down by misfortune and forces of nature, Lynxia always rises from its ashes – stronger still. Lynxia plays a lone wolf in the world of politics and alliances, always striking on its own, relying on no one. It stands tall against all those who oppose it. Between the militaristic traditions, [[Empress of Iron]], and the invention of gunpowder, it is a force to be reckoned with.
