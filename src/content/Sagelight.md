Sagelight is the least prestigious degree awarded by the Highest University of Acaadia. But make no mistake, it is still very respectable title, and for many it is the end goal of their academic career.

This is the sort of degree you obtain if you do not want to dedicate yourself to the university, and you treat academia as a means to an end, rather than the actual goal.

It is fairly common to see people with this degree in major cities, and you could still one or two in some other settlements.
