## Adamant - the sword of nature
### Origins
The **blade of nature** is forged out of **Alkahl**. In fact, the common word for *Alkahl* is **Adiamantium**, word inspired by this very sword. The blade was initially given to *Ral'Kalhamier*, a master craftself, and the legendary architect, who according to the legends famously designed the [[Air gardens]].

### Abilities, traits & feats
**Adamant** was forged to aid his master at his work. It was given the ability to shape stone, alter it to its master's will. Hardening the foundations of tall towers, or leveling mountains - all within the power of this tool.

According to one legend, *RalKalhamier* propped the **Rin'weltharis**, ancient (and believed to be the first) flying city, against the fabric of the weave using the sword. The weight of the stone could not bend the will of the sword. Thus the city hovers in the sky to this day. Motionless, stalwart. 

*RalKalhamier* was believed to be one of the best transmuters in elven lore. However, his abilities seem to amplify around the point he was given the Adamant. Changing copper to gold, coal to wood, mercury to water, it is all abilities we are told he mastered, but only after he had his sword. The consensus now, according to lore masters, is that these are actually sword's abilities instead.

Finally, the sword was said to return vigor and strength to the nature around it. Its healing abilities occasionally extend to other elves, but never to the wielder himself, interestingly. Some even speculate, that sword is able to return soul back to its body, but there is no actual lore witnessing such occurrence.
  
## References in other cultures
Adamant bears striking resemblance to some legendary blades of other cultures. Some suggest this is simply a cultural assimilation of those concepts, others suggest the actual blade has found its way to other races.

The most notorious example is **The Excalibur**, the sword in the stone in [[Bryten|Bryten Kingdom]] mythology. It is easy to see why historians made the connection. Blade able to cut and mold the stone, sword that, as all Elven swords, only answers to soul of noble heart... the similarities add up.

In [[Nomad|Nomads of the Infinite Desert]] mythos, [[Laumor|Nomad pantheon & Culture#laumor-memory-of-greener-plains]] used a branch to destroy the [[The Godfall Citadel]] in one swipe. After he died, the branch supposedly shattered and each shard flew far away, eventually settling and sprouting the oases. The timeline (nor the wielder of the blade) does not make much sense for the Adamant, but there are several convincing theories proposing that Adamant IS this *branch*.

## Inveritum - the sword of knowledge
### Origins
Also known as **sword of truth**. The blade was forged for **Eliriel D'Minarion**, the *seer of seers*. Sword is made out of **Nekahl** (Etherium) to tap into the etheral realm and its secret. *Eliriel* saw the creation of the swords in his visions and was often the one who helped with locating the resources needed for the swords, often even accompanying the heroes on their journeys to obtain them.

*Elriel* was also responsible for some of the (now lost) know-how and we know he was present during the creation of at least one sword. While we do not know much about his relation to **Gaius**, *the Blacksmith of Legends*, but Gaius always spoke highly of Elriel (and vice versa). Many theorize that they often shared insights into their respective areas of expertise, nicely complementing each other.

Elriel was quite intelligent, even for High Elf standards. Oftentimes it was not clear whether it was his visions that guided him, or simply deduction and foresight. Though we know he saw the creation of his sword, he did not know when it happened, and he knew better than to simply have the sword forged anyway. He started looking, digging for a reason and method of the creation of the swords. Soon enough he found why... unfortunately, he never shared the reason. Secondary sources often claim he sensed some threat to the weave. Though most of the swords were gifts or requests, Elriel seems to have claimed they all had a secondary purpose.  

### Abilities, traits & feats
Inveritum's abilities are by far known the least (with the obvious exception). Elriel rarely shared his thoughts with others, so all sources we have are secondary at best. He was almost never seen with his sword, and he reportedly hid it away shortly before his death, claiming to "do his best to ensure the sword will only come back to the right hands".

The sword knows the location of all the other *Swords of Legend* (with the exception of *Elvarias*), and can command any other weapon to reveal its true form.

It is rumoured that **Inveritum** can even mimic lesser magical swords perfectly, often with greater intensity. While it may not be too surprising for high-power magical artifacts to adapt some properties of other items, the fact Inveritum can do this for ANY magical weapon is quite astonishing. For quite some time this was dismissed as a rumour, however, recently [[Acaademics|Independent land of Acaadia]] found a theoretical "loophole" for an object to behave this way. Of course, some of the values are outside of what is practically possible.
 
## Repentus - the sword of tradition
 
## Ablegaris - the sword of mercy
### Origins
Also known as The blade of compassion or **Elven courage**, was forged out **Lukahl** (Moonmetal) for **Galindar F'Krasilie**, a hero of many elven stories. The blade was a gift from the forge-master for *Galindar*, to remind him who he is - a light in the night.
  
## Venialis - the sword of redemption
### Origins
**Venialis** also goes by names **Burn of guilt** and **Gaius' curse**.
  
## Laboreus - the sword of duty
###Origins
Sometime also known as The **Blood binder** is a blade requested by **Tiriandel La'torus** to bind himself to his duties - to stand guard of the elven people and their ideals, no matter how dark the path gets. The story of the *Blood-binder* begins right after the Tiriandel's expeditions to the *Dark depths* where his resolve was greatly tested. Since he was the last guardian of the **Dark depths**, he decided it would be better if something bound him to his duties there. The blood-binder is that something.

To meet the requirements of the job, the blade was forged out of the dreaded **Rexkahl**  (Blood metal).
 
## Elvarias - the master sword
### Origins
**Elvarias** goes by many names: the blade of blades, the ruler of swords, the first blade or **King of swords**.

The creation of Elvarias is shrouded in mystery. One version of the story claims the sword is forged from the alloy of all the metals. Some claim entirely different material. Some even suggest less... conventional components. Although the stories tend to agree on the meaning of the sword. The creation of the swords introduced an imbalance to the weave, and their spirits clashed. Thus the master sword was forged - to rule over the others. To calm their energies and to stabilize the tension of the weave. There must always be an Elvarias, it is now simply a law of the universe. Interestingly, academics actually tried to run the numbers. Although the magnitudes are ridiculously off the charts, the maths checks out and in principle.
