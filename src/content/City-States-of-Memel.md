Memel may seem unremarkable to many, when its anything but. Since [[Bryten|Bryten Kingdom]] agreed to protect its borders and coasts, [[Elves|Elven kingdom]] are unlikely to attack and [[Nomads|Nomads of the Infinite Desert]] have proven to be ineffective outside their desert, City states of Memel could focus on developing their industry and wealth. And so they did - although their precision and engineering could not rival that of [[Lynxian|Lynxian Empire]] engineers, they make up for it using their transmutations and alchemy.
