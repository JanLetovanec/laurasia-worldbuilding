# The Inquisition

> **We see. We know. We act.**<br>
> -- Inquisition's motto

Also known as *Eye of gods*, or *The all-seeing eye*.

**The Inquisition** is a neutral player with respect to politics and diplomacy. However, due to the fact it's headquarters is located in **Capitol** ([[Republic of Galicia]]), many think of it more as a Galician invention. Regardless, the Inquisition concerns itself with the singular goal - appointing new [[Inquisitors|Inquisitor]] to root out injustices and seek out evil. Informally, they certify and train elite detectives and send them out into the world.

Inquisition is well-respected and **High Inquisitors** posses considerable power, influence and assets. That being said, Inquisition leaves its members with wide choice of means and goals, and thus exhibits very little power over them. Still, getting Inquisition's attention is not a horrible idea (unless you hide something... which you surely don't, do you?) as they pass on viable cases to Inquisitors and eventually someone will try to solve it.

An interesting fact, is that even [[Elves|Elven Kingdom]] recognize the authority of Inquisition, which is grounds to many conspiracy theories.

## Specialty
As hinted above, The Inquisition is unrivaled when it comes to investigative jobs (arguably with the exception of [[Redcoats - Investigative Division]]). You would be hard-pressed to come up with a case that Inquisitor could not solve. The problem is making them to try to solve it, though you have a couple of options.

Inquisition as a whole has a reputation of an incorruptible entity. Gold and favours will get you nowhere. You need to prove that your problem is serious. Prove this is evil's doing! Once you get their attention, the rest should be easy.

Alternatively, you can appeal to the Inquisitors directly, offering gold and resources. Though this is less effective, as Inquisitors tend to have a lot of offers and generally are not in need of money. Much better angle of attack would be to appeal to their curiosity. After all, who could resist a good mystery...
