Dragonlight is a class of degrees under the [[Acadic Honorifics]]. Highest degrees of this group are the most prestigious degrees that can be obtained studying outside the **Highest University of Acaadia**.
This rank is divided into the following sub-ranks:

* Junior Dragonlight
* Senior Dragonlight
* Dragonlight proper
* post Dragonlight

By becoming the Dragonlight, you chose to implicitly dedicate your career to academia, and become so called true academic. You now know how academia works, you know the right circles, the right practices. You can now do proper research.

Dragonlights are few and far between. It is extremely tough degree, and thus not many people actually getting the degree decide to sever their ties to university. It is rare to find Dragonlights outside the Acaadia, but there are a couple of them at major universities across the Laurasia. But outside the universities, it is essentially impossible to find one. There few individuals conducting field studies or some resolving academic issues outside the university, but you can count them on your fingers.

## Requirements
* have a proper degree
* pass the Dragonlight examination in the given field
* pass the review of your examination and recent works
* have at least 5 published papers / 1 shattering paper
* publish at least 1 paper on your own
* prove your expertese to *the Bivigilators*
* prove the validity of your 5 most recent papers to [[Magelights|Magelight]] 
* complete the graduation ceremony

## Appointment
Graduating to **Junior Dragonlight** and **post Dragonlight** are associated with ceremonious events, but other degrees simply require passing the proper examination procedures.

Regardless, if there is any ceremony, it is similar to [[Magelight]]
graduation ceremony, but there are some additional hoops you need to jump through.

Namely, instead of just being question by *Biviligators*, you can be question by any Dragonlights present, and any [[Magelights|Magelight]] present can question you about your latest published paper.

After the Q&A, Biviligators ask the audience for any reasons the subject should not be awarded this degree. Subject can defend themselves and address the objections. This happens rarely, and if it does, it is usually staged. But sometimes people genuinely find some intriguing reasons.

If everything comes to a conlusion smoothly, Biviligators and a selected jury of [[Magelights|Magelight]] or Dragonlights vote on the final decision.

Biviligators then announce the degree awarded to the subject.

## Duties
You are to contribute to the academic community in meaningful manner. You need to publish one paper a year, although, there is no real penalty for failing to do so (although it makes graduation to higher degrees problematic).

You are also expected to run for **Biviligator** from time to time, and are responsible for peer-reviewing published papers.
If there are some disputes in regards to your field of study, you may be called in to resolve the issue.

## Benefits
You get same privileges [[Magelights|Magelight]] have. 
In addition, however, you can off-load some of the tasks to Magelights, to allow you to "focus on the bigger picture".

You can also request access to any paper (including topics not in your field of expertise).

You can even review archived papers, although, you can only summon the author, once there is reasonable doubt that the paper was plagiarized or otherwise strongly offends the *academic code*. You can point out poor practices, but only for correction purposes. 

You have a considerable power to decide where the resources of the University flow. That is, your opinion can significantly influence which projects get funded and which do not.

## Accoutrements & Equipment
* Dragonlight wizard hat
* Academic gown
* Certificate of Dragonlight expertise
* Red ribbon (will be signed by Grand wizard, if the results were exceptional)
* Wand
* Diplomat's pouch

## Grounds for Removal/Dismissal
Dragonlights can be disgraced, by procedure formally known as *Prosecution of the Oathbreaker*. The reasons for doing so would include (non-exhaustively) cheating, academic theft, misbehaving (academically).
