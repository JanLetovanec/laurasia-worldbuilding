# Independent land of Acaadia

Few can compete with arcane prowess of the [[Elves|Elven kingdom]]. Acaadia is one of those few that can. Brilliant minds from all over the Laurasia come here to sharpen their knowledge of the occult and arcane as well as more natural studies.

Home to most prestigious universities, housing arguably the best libraries in the world, Acaadia offers more than enough for any curious mind.

Renown of the acaadic universities is second to none and its authority allowed for standardization of many procedures, titles and degrees throughout the Laurasia.

Even the word 'academic' traces its origins to this very chunk of land.
