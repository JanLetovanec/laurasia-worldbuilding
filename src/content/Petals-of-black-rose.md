#Petals of black rose

**Petals of a black rose** is a [[Lynxian|Lynxian Empire]] version of a **Thieve's guild** (and often referred to that way). However, unlike others of its kind, Petals of a black rose are more selective. Not everyone makes it into their ranks. 
Some even say there is a secret to it, some say they find you... but nobody knows for sure.

## Specialty
As expected, Petals suffer a lot of in-fighting (even for a criminal organization).

However, with respect to outside contracts, they specialize in high-profile missions. Be it run-downs, sieges, heists or hostage situations, Petals will provide you with the team that is needed. At a hefty price, that is.
