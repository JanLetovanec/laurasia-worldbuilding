The Infinite desert is a strange place. You would be forgiven if you deemed Nomads “unimportant” in the grand scheme of things – no armies, mages, or wealth of note, it poses little threat to other nations. But its strengths lie elsewhere – the clouds of sand and the magical trickery offers obscurity and protection from prying eyes. There are many who wish to not be seen, and many more that wish to employ the former. They all converge here, away from the reach of the arm of law.
