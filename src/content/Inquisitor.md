The most elite detectives in Laurasia are awarded a unique title - the title of **the Inquisitor**. Inquisitors are feared and respected, they are certainly a force to be reckoned with. They are incorruptible. They may not pose an immediate threat to you, but they do get results.

## Duties
Formally, Inquisitors are to assist law anywhere across the Laurasia they wish. They are not bound to any place or institution and can withdraw the case at any point (although you have never read/heard that this has happened). They may overtake any case and deploy (almost) any method.

However, casting judgement or enacting punishment is strictly out of their authority (you heard that many Inquisitors prefer it that way).

## Benefits
Inquisitor can overtake any ongoing investigation or initiate a new one if they see fit. No explanation is required, and any kind of law enforcement or other forces is subject to their command. That is, the Law must assist an Inquisitor in (almost) any way they ask for. Their rights are not unlimited, but they are significant.
As a consequence, they can choose freely which case they devote themselves to.

In addition, Inquisitors cannot be prosecuted, although this has not been a problem in ages.

Interestingly, they are one of the few titles that are recognized by [[Elven kingdom]]. 

Finally, their services are well-sought after. Many factions (good or evil) are in need of such Inquisitors and are prepared to pay for them. Hence, Inquisitors are often *hired* in this way, but that is strictly informal matter. Some Inquisitors do prefer only tough cases (to sort of test their mettle) and are not swayed by such payments.

## Grounds for Removal/Dismissal
There are no known cases of an Inquisitor being dismissed. But there ARE procedures for doing that.
Unfortunately, they are only known to Inquisitors as far as you can tell...
