#Pawn's gambit
**Pawn's gambit** is lose circle of criminal elements in [[Ragnaria|Ragnarian empire]]. Nobody, as far as you can tell, knows exactly how they got it's name, but it is rumoured that they only admit only the best players of **Golem's fate** (game similar to chess, popular in Ragnaria). Either way, little is known about the Pawns, other than that they operate within their own laws and rules.
  
## Specialty
While other groups tend to work with money and favours, Paws recognize that **information** is the King. Espionage, scouting and information trading are what Pawns excel at. However, as a consequence gold is rarely of any value for Pawns, thus you are forced into less conventional methods of payment.
