# Acadic Honorifics
Acadic Honorifics are a group of academic titles, originally founded by **Acaadian universities**. Acaadia then pushed hard to make these titles wildly recognized and it quickly became universally adopted by any reasonable university in Laurasia.

These titles are highly regarded and for some, even getting the lowest ranking title of Acadic Honorifics is a worthy goal. Most titles can be obtain regardless of where you study, but the most prestigious ones are specific to Highest University of Acaadia.

Usually, this titles are granted for life, unless you are **disgraced** - an Acaadian way of saying you have been found cheating at some point of your academic career. Academic community takes such of offenses very seriously, and once you have been convicted, your career (academically) is over. There are no do-overs or retries (not even dying).
