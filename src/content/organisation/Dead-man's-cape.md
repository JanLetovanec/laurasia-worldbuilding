# Dead man's cape

> **In need we come, in peace we leave**<br>
> -Motto of Dead man's cape

There is a lot of competing lore and superstition about the true nature of Dead man's cape. There are some who doubt it even exists. No surprise for an order veiled in secrecy, sacrifice and heroism.

While they have no known leadership or headquarters, many believe they come from [Galicia](/region/republic-of-galicia), though there are supposed sightings all over the Western continent.

They help the common people with little to no regard to authorities or law. Thus they earned many names and favours, both good and bad.

Nobody quite knows where they are now - they mostly disappeared. There are some who believe they are all dead. Some say they are watching, silently judging from afar. Others tell stories of upcoming war, a disaster that will endanger the Human kingdoms. But one thing is common among the rumours... 

In the times of Great Need, they will answer their call.<br> 
Once again, they shall rise up from the shadows.<br>
And they shall protect us all.<br>
One. Last. Time.
