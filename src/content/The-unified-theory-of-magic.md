# The unified theory of magic
Scholars and mages have tried to come up with a single system for magic, that would be capable of describing all existing magic, but also predicting new styles of spells and rituals.

However, as for today, there is no clear explanation to account for all styles, and so multiple schools of thought have been developed.
