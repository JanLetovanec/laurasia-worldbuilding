title: Magelight
slug: magelight
---
One of the lower-ranking [[Acadic Honorifics]]. People  being granted this title are few and far between, but it is not unusual to come across someone with such title outside of the Academia.

People not in studying at university with this title are often very successful in their respective branches, and are often senior arcane advisors or engineers.

## Requirements

* basic education
* advanced education
* pass the Magelight examination in the given field
* be a recognized member of academic community
* knowledge of the arcane matters (or other field) proven to the Bivigilators
* lead a recognized research project or make a substantial discovery

## Appointment

Once the criteria has been met, the new Magelight is given a certificate, a honorary hat and a gown in fairly informal manner.
Then publicly, Magelight takes an **Academic Oath** and must truthfully answer the **Bivigilators** question (all of this is happening publicly in a ceremonious manner). These questions usually concern the moral aspect - that is whether the Magelight has not cheated, and whether they will contribute to the academic community, but also sometimes question the magelight for knowledge. This is however, usually just a ceremony and questions tent to be known beforehand, but in some cases, when you have angered Bivigilators, or there are some concerns, this may be an actual test.

After that Biviligators announce the new Magelights name and his new rank. They are officially a Magelight.

## Duties
Supervise new Magelight adepts, research and some proof-reading of Dragonlights work.

Magelights are expected to contribute to the academic community in some way, but are not obligated to do so.

## Benefits
Magelights are well respected among the academic communities.

In addition, they can question any non-archived papers for plagiarism, poor-research practices and other aspects. This may involve forcing the author to see the Magelight in some cases.

Furthermore, they allowed to request access to any ongoing research (in their field of study). While published research is in public domain, ongoing research are considered private, and are only accessible to anyone working on the project and Magelights (+ higher degrees).

Finally, a Magelight is often required to certify certain standards, or resolve certain issues by law, which gives Magelight pretty lucrative career opportunities.

## Accoutrements & Equipment
* Magelights wizard hat
* Academic gown
* Certificate of Magelight expertise
* Blue ribbon signed by Dragonlight and a quill (awarded for exceptional result)

## Grounds for Removal/Dismissal
There is only one way to dismiss a Magelight  and that is to disgrace them.

This pocess is formally known as **Prosecution of the Oathbreaker**.

This requires that the Prosecutor proves that the Magelight was not honest during taking the Oath, namely that they are guilty of academic theft, plagiarism or otherwise cheating during his promotion to Magelight. This is very similar to a court case, but it is handled by academic institution itself.

## History
Originally a degree specific to Acaadia. However after the Unification act it was universally recognized. It did not take long for other nations to adopt these degrees as their own.
