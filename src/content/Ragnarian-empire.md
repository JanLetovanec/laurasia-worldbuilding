Ragnaria may not boast the greatest wealth, nor best trained armies and yet, they are hardly the underdogs. 
Master spies, excellent strategists, and good mages all contribute to Ragnaria's success. They like to pretend to be "the good guys" of history, but they mostly keep to themselves, always seeking to improve their situation.
