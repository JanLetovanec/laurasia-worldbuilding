# Arch Wizard
This is the highest degree that can ever be awarded, and can only be obtained at **Highest University of Acaadia**. No greater honour can be be bestowed upon you, at least when it comes to academic prowess.

Not only that, but there can only be a single living Arch Wizard. The exact degree you get depends on you [[Grand Wizard]] degree - that is you get *Arch Enchanter* if you were *Grand Enchanter*, and so on.

Usually, there is no Arch Wizard (unlike Grand Wizards, which are more or less essential to the University). It has been roughly 50 years since the last **Arch Invoker**.
