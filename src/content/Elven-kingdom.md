Elvaria is a mysterious piece of land. They stay out of the most conflicts and politics, but they do protect their land fiercely. Many ancient sources describe the wars with Elves and they do end up badly for the offenders.... and thus nobody tried again in ages. Nobody knows whether the stories are true.
Elves also not respect many authorities and institutions, with two notable exceptions.

The first one is the [[League of Kingdoms]] - with [[Bryten|Bryten kingdom]] as its leader. The reasons are mostly pragmatic: benefit outweigh the costs, but also, Elves do not wish wars, which is the core philosophy of the League.

The second, somewhat mysterious one, is the institute of [[The Inquisition]]. Inquisitors are well-respected (along with their authority and rights) on Elven soil, which is not true for any other professions (such as Kings, priests or ambassadors).
