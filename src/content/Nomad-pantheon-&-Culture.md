>    Let me sing you a story of a hero. Of greener plains. Of desire. And of loss.<br>
>    — *Freni, Stories told by merry folk* 

 
# Laumor, Memory of greener plains
**Laumor** is believed (by Nomands) to be a dead **Elven god**. He was supposed to be the god of nature, fruition, and abundance. Under his reign few would suffer, and if so, not from famine or poverty. It takes only a single look at the geography of the *Infinite Desert* to see why Nomads believe he is dead.

But not all were willing to trade happiness for free will. That is why Laumor was killed. But some of his legacy still remains, since even some of his successor gods took something away from his teachings. His death sent a clear message to all who would trifle with Nomads – Nomads shall not be bound!

## Life domain
**Laumor** invaded the lands of the Nomads spreading his teachings and conquering what disagreed. The nature spread. To Nomads, nature, albeit beneficial and maybe even benevolent to those who embrace it, is a violation of one’s free will. It offers no choice. Resistance was inevitable. And eventually, the nature, a god himself, was bested by invention of folks. But there was no one to fill in the space left by a dead god. And with Laumor, his boons died too.

Life expands, bulldozes what’s around and plants the seeds of more life all around, asking no questions of the soil, rivers, or rain. But often, the land is better for it. Not always, however.

Corollary to that: **life always finds a way**. Even though Laumor is dead, bits of him still prevail. Couple of oases exist within the desert around which the life and nature flourish. Equally, Laumor still has some followers, ranging from desperate farmers hoping to survive next day through noblemen trying to remember simpler times all the way to the cultists devoted to brining Laumor back.  

## Water domain
Laumor’s teaching are simple – do not resist. Simply **adapt to the flow**. Like water that meets a rock – it doesn’t try to crack it, nor does it try to move it away. It simply flows around it. We too should simply flow from one day to the next, enjoying what we have, and not caring for grudges or unreasonable duties. 

## Domains & Symbol
A maple leaf.    

# Datara, Vision mirrored in the heatwaves of the sandy dunes
**Datara**, the god of ingenuity, freedom, and civilisation, is **the architect** behind the [[weapon that struck down a god|Godstrike]]. And in the emptiness that followed, he and couple of his comrades were elevated to godhood.

## Freedom domain
Only a **mind free of oppression** can wander, think, and create. Only unbound hands can craft great inventions. Only a creation of unforced will is worth celebrating. Afterall, slave labour is only a creation of their master.

The greatest craftsmen of all, **Datara**, could not think freely under Laumor’s rule and understood that something needs to be done. Datara was not a violent man, but in his wisdom, he knew that the best solution is sometimes the most extreme one. One should be careful, however, since one can easily become the very thing one fights against!
  
## Craftsmen domain
**Datara**’s father was a gardener. He was one with nature, often gathering and hunting for his family back when *The Infinite Desert* was full of green pastures. But one day, Datara's father got poisoned by one of his flowers. He claimed it was **Laumor**’s gift, that nothing so beautiful can be so vile. But he was wrong.

After his father’s death, Datara vowed that from that day he will strive to make mankind rely solely on itself, rather than the sour gifts of nature. To put a clear dividing line between the fickle nature and mankind. He studied the sciences and made sure, that his people were self-reliant. No more gatherers, no more hunting of wild game. Only farmlands and tools.

But the nature cannot be bound. And even though humans built their walls, and houses, bound their livestock by fences, and stomped the forests with roads, Laumor never gave up on what was his. He tempted mankind with laziness and comfort. But the hardworking Datara knew the price of his temptations. After years of trying, Laumor cursed his adversaries – doomed them to the hard-work in their fields and mines. To earn their bread with sweat and blood. But Datara did not budge.

When it was clear that the only way of solving the issue was to kill Laumor, he got to work. He worked tirelessly, and with the help of Oxartes’ designs, he forged the [[Godstrike]]– a weapon that would kill a god.

## Time domain
Even though Laumor died at the **Godfall**, his wisdom lived on.

After the Godfall, there was a lot to do. Things seemed hopeless. Although the hot-headed humans were victorious, it was now time to face the consequences. Famines and droughts ravaged the lands. All this time they worked day and night, acted swiftly to eradicate the threats of wilderness. And now that it was gone, he finally had time to think.

He realized what Laumor wanted – and it was precisely to avoid this. A march of progress took a heavy toll on everyone – his friends, his family, even himself. He could not rebuild a land today. He could not forge a wand that would undo the damage. The rebuilding efforts would take decades, maybe even centuries.<br>
But he would see to it that they WILL rebuild.  

## Domains & Symbol
A cube of dark stone, usually onyx.    

# Groker, Glimpse of the un-sailed seas and distant shores
Before the Godfall, Groker was a huntsman and Datara’s cousin. His parents got lost in the nearby forest, so he spent most of his upbringing with Datara and his family. He was the sort of person who worked best with a goal – a set of orders to follow. Without them, his mind declined.
Groker took the death of his uncle, Datara’s father, very hard. Some think that this was the reason Datara acted with such zeal and determination. Either way, Groker’s mind deteriorated without his uncle’s directions, but fortunately, Datara’s project to detach from the nature’s firm grasp kept his mind occupied. For a while.

Groker succumbed to the Laumor’s temptations many a time. His mind was corrupted by years he spent as a huntsman; his instincts battled with his mind. But he had friends who, in the end, always reminded him the error of Laumor’s ways.

But the damage was done. Groker’s mind was too damaged by Laumor’s corruption. Groker, once a peaceful hunter, became a vengeful warrior. In a very strange twist of fate, Laumor created the means of his own doom – for Groker was the one who wielded the [[Godstrike]].

## Domain of hostilities
Groker was a simple man. Being the closest one of his peers to Laumor, he often saw the appeal of his teachings. But there was a wisdom he never unlearned: often, the best solution is simple. Simple, elegant but a difficult, brutal.

He learned that sometimes you need to make tough calls, felling his enemies for good, rather than to forge complex diplomatic relationships. Not to back down when pressed too hard. Sometimes you must be the one throws the first stone. In fact, Groker was first of his colleagues that argued to strike Laumor down in an open combat. While he was the muscle and initial voice behind the decision to kill a god.

Violence and aggression is viewed differently for different folk in Laurasia. Some see it as failure – letting emotions get the better of you, some as source of inner strength, because few things can stand in the way of raging mind. For Nomads though, it serves very pragmatic purpose. Violence is always an option. Often the simplest one.  

### War efforts
Nomads have little in terms of natural resources, but some cities possess significant wealth. Due to the disconnected nature of Nomad settlements, most organized armies tend to fail, and thus they often either deploy mercenaries or opt for more guerrilla-styled combat, very effective at punishing back any aggressors. That is not to say that they did not try offense – there was a long-lasting campaign against [[Lynxian Empire]] but were very quickly pushed back. In addition, [[League of Kingdoms]] has very little leverage on Nomads, so they are much more willing to march into a war than any other nation. Fortunately, these invasions were never really successful.
  
## Fire domain
Groker is arguably the most misunderstood god. Many think of Groker as a simple raging barbarian, destroying what he can. Fueled only by anger and vengeance. But that is a mistake, and those who truly understand what Groker stands for worship the Groker’s domain of fire. Many think that anger, much like fire, is wild, uncontrollable, destructive. But much like fire, violence and anger can be useful tools. Only those who can understand and master them can truly control them. And therefore, only those who understand the most nuanced of Groker’s teachings control the forces of fire.
There is cold calculus to the brutality of murder and extermination. If you burn down a forest to ashes, it will not grow back. If you crush your problems for good, they cannot come back to bite you later. A simple solution to come up with, if not to execute. It is merely a question of strength and power. And for those who know how to wield that power, Groker will provide.  

## Unity domain
It is important to remember why Groker decided to side with his comrades in the end and why he struck down a god. It is the same reason why his comrades saved him from Laumor many a time. There is strength in comradery and numbers. It took a mind, body, and soul to strike down a god. And when his friends united, there was little that could stand in their way.

It is important to say, though, none of them did it out of sense of loyalty or kindness. They simply recognized the value of a team, to bond together against the corruption. It was necessary and pragmatic reasoning, rather than warm and moral one.

One should not be forced to accept the system, nor be bound bind it against their will. But, by their own will, they cannot enjoy the fruits of it.  

### City states, law and government
The capital, and pretty much the core of Nomad diplomacy, is [[The Godfall Citadel]], which is effectively run by **Thieves Guild**. Those who disagree with the rules and laws are free to leave – it is their free choice. Many cities around the Infinite Desert’s oases were formed precisely this way – some clan decided to strike on their own and try their luck. The end result is that The Infinite Desert is really just a collection of independent city states scattered around the desert. With the limitations impose by the geography, any laws, war efforts and diplomacy must be handled locally, and unless a lot of gold changes hand, it will never leave the walls of any given city.  

## Madness domain
Madness is a mind lacking purpose and discipline. It is a natural state of mind and, if left alone, every mind will eventually break and crumble. But it can be prevented, even restored. It is important to have a goal and strike balance, however, because too much of anything can drive one to madness.

But there is more wisdom to Groker’s teachings. He might not be the brightest of his colleagues, but he understood that simplicity is often the best way to go. While Oxartes often plotted and schemed, Groker often got the job done quicker and without unintended consequences. A simple mind is blessed with clarity and sees the world clearly for what it is. It cannot conceive of convoluted plots or trickery.  

## Domains & Symbol
A mineral or metal with jagged edges, unusually uncut or unprocessed. Typically made from copper.    

# Oxartes, Knowledge of the cryptic clues and broken rules
Oxartes was a druid before he met Datara. Datara being a craftsman, the two often exchanged ideas and schematics. Oxartes quickly became enthralled by his idea. He quickly realized that there were limits to what he could learn from nature. Once he started living in Datara’s city, away from nature, he resumed his arcane studies in earnest. He quickly became one of the most respected mages and quite often designed and improved plans for Datara.

Oddly enough, he was the one who was the last one to accept the decision to kill Laumor. He did not like the nature or Laumor himself, but he believed they can parasite on his gifts, maybe even use his powers to their benefit. He always knew how to twist and turn the situation to his liking, though he rarely shared his plans with his colleagues.

However, he believed in the Datara’s system, and as he saw that the council voted to kill Laumor, he changed his mind. He started to work tirelessly on the designs for a new weapon. Groker’s arms wielded the Godstrike, Datara’s hammer forged it, but it was Datara’s mind that conceived such a weapon.

Oxartes is a patron of mages and politicians – intelligence and patience are virtues valued greatly by Oxartes. While Datara might have think he ruled over his city, he was often guided by Oxartes’ suggestions. He often had a secondary motive to bend the city to his means. But neither Datara, nor anyone else considered this a problem, since ultimately, they all wanted the same thing: to break free.  

## Navigation domain
Killing a god was only a first step. Many things were wrong. The wilderness stopped making sense… or whatever was left of it. Deserts consumed everything beyond most city walls. Deserts that were impossible to navigate because the space itself bent and illusions would confuse any mind trying to explore the wilderness. 

Oxartes was one of the few humans that could read the desert’s whims. He took it upon himself to map the safe passageways to other cities and plot the routes for many merchants that would follow. If the stories are true, we rely on his maps to this day and many guides pray to Oxartes to aid them in their travels. 

One day, however, Oxartes did not come back from his journey. Datara sent scouts to retrieve whatever they could – a clue, body, anything. But to no avail. Oxartes vanished in the sandy mists of Infinite desert. Some believe this was Oxartes’ plan all along, and that this was part of his plot. Some say he learned how to ascend to godhood, and this was the beginning. Others believe that his pride consumed him and in his lust for knowledge he ventured the most complicated route and got lost. Some even claim his spirit haunts certain regions of the desert. 
 
### Preparation, travel & exploration
Nomad take preparation very seriously. They see travelers as either brave or foolhardy. While they understand the risks of venturing into the unknown, they believe that they can tame it by careful planning and appropriate equipment. After all, not even a god could withstand a might of Oxartes’ mind.

In most cities, it is a minor event every time a guide or courier decides to brave the deserts. Often a celebratory party is held in one of the local taverns to wish best of luck to the adventurer and celebrate their determination and bravery.  

## Oath-keeper’s domain

>    The city has no judge. No jury. No executioner. If none are fit for the job, I will.<br>
>    — *Oxartes* 

During the early days of the Datara’s First city, there were people who would break the law and took advantage of Datara’s efforts if left unchecked. The cold, calculating mind combined with the unrivalled might of his magics made him a great judge… and executioner. Few would dare to get on the Oxartes’ bad side, so often his presence would be enough to make them uphold their end of the deal.

This newly found trust in deals and oaths, backed by the might and wrath of Oxartes, allowed the city to grow in power. But make no mistake, Oxartes didn’t do this out of the goodness of his heart. His power grew as he was now in control of all oaths and deals.  

### Jury, judge & executioner
Nomads believe that right to judge needs to be earned. But by earning it, you should be able to enact your judgement. It is considered impolite, sometimes even grounds for further retribution, to cast a judgement of any kind, if you don’t have what it takes to execute it.

While the Citadel police rarely investigates things, when they do people rarely object. Only the most capable warriors manage to get into their well-paid ranks, so any funny business around them may quickly end badly for you.  

## Unshackled domain

>    That which is not enforced, should be allowed.<br>
>    — *Nomad proverb* 

It is important to keep in mind what Datara and his companions were fighting for: to rid themselves free of Laumor’s rule. Many might think that they only swapped the Laumor’s rule for rule of the law and civilisation. But there is an important distinction: not a single person was forced to live within the walls of the First city. None of the laws applied to you if you did not agree.

Oxartes, as many Nomads, believe that you should only be bound if you agree to be bound. A human mind strives to be free. And it should be free. At any time, you should be able to break your shackles if you wish to. No power, no institution, no law should limit you if you don’t wish so. But you must be strong and brave enough to bear the consequences.  

### Free market
Nomads are big on the free market. They believe that healthy competition in all things will balance things out, resulting in a fair system. As a result, the trade is very unregulated, if at all. Consequentially, it is the go-to market to trade illegal goods, hire assassins or do other more legally questionable business. However, its not all cut-throats and brutes out there – this system allowed works for normal everyday people, it’s just that usually that is not the reason you went all the way to infinite desert.

Furthermore, you should challenge the powers that be. The system is only as strong as strongly it can be enforced. A force that cannot be enforced should not be obeyed. The rebellion is always just, if for nothing else, then it at least tests the system and its powers. You can’t, nor should you, be bound by things that can’t reach you.  

### Diplomacy
Formally, Infinite desert is **no man’s land**. Only [[The Godfall Citadel]] maintains diplomatic relationship with the others and thus is not responsible for action of all the other cities found within the deserts. [[League of Kingdoms]] has tried many times to bind Nomads to certain treaties, demanding to deport criminals, or punish them for the aggression against [[Lynxians|Lynxian Empire]], but they failed every single time.

Nomads are simply too smart to give up their scapegoat, knowing very well that authorities can’t touch them on their home turf.

## Domain of thought
More popular by the name: **Domain of two thoughts**, or more prerogative: **Church of Contradiction**. The followers of this domain often practice holding multiple contradicting thoughts earnestly. It is said that Oxartes of the master of this art and was capable of truly believing in multiple ideas at once. This was the source of his true power according to some – be it confusing those who would read his mind, pursuing his goals with zeal, even though he might disagree with the means, or leaving open certain possibilities.

This is a popular train of thought, however, even without this church – many Nomads think that believes can overlap and someone can, with full honesty, act in contradicting manner. The real world is complicated and so is human mind. What we call believes are simply imperfect representations of fragments of ideas. Truly brilliant mind can work with and combine even the most incompatible pieces.

Finally, only a bright mind can understand why the rules are set as they are, and only it can break them with impunity. Laws and rules exist to bind lesser minds. But you need capacity to understand why the rules are there in the first place to break them. 
 
## Domain of the obscure
Domain of plots, schemes, and lies. Oxartes has never failed his assignments. He never lost a battle. But it was not luck, for luck runs out. It was preparation and surgical precision of picking his battles.

Revealing your intentions is often seen as foolish or short-sighted and many will simply suspect you for hiding something else. Your thoughts and opinions are yours and yours only. You should only voice them when it’s advantageous to you.

Nomads are interesting bunch when it comes to promises and requests. While many may consider it rude to decline, it is completely fine with Nomads. The issue is accepting and failing. You should always think twice before offering to help.  

### Magic
Oxartes, being the first human mage according to the Nomad mythos, is unsurprisingly a patron of mages and academics. He rewards intelligence, planning with willpower, insight and power.
  
### True naming
It is common in the Infinite deserts to use pseudonyms and nicknames predominantly, rather than your name. You would reserve your true name for the family and close friends, but you would use your nick publicly. Many historians believe that this tradition has roots in [[Elven Kingdom]], since pretty much all elven mages prefer not to use their true name to avoid being targeted by true naming magic. Although Nomads have not invented [[True naming|Theory of Magic#true-naming]], they contributed heavily to our modern understanding of it (although lately, [[Acaadia|Independent lands of Acaadia]] is the de-facto authority on true-naming research). It is rumored that the magic behind the [[Godstrike]] was simply normal weapon with engraving of Lau’s true name.
 
## Domains & Symbol

# Farnah, Recollection of betrayals lined with gold
Farnah, like Groker, betrayed humanity multiple times. But while Groker’s decisions were seen as a mistake and stemmed from the corruption of his mind, Farnah’s betrayal is way more personal and less easily justifiable. At least… on the surface.  

## Domain of gold
Farnah was, first and foremost, honest in his misdoings. He never hid the fact that he does what he does for riches, and he often warned people that he will always work for the highest bidder. Unfortunately, it was not always humans. Many Nomads strongly believe in this paradigm. There is no shame in being in it for gold, but you need to be honest about it. That way, betrayals are never personal. It’s simply business.  

### Honour among thieves

>    **Just doing the bid’s bidding** – Nomad excuse, akin to “just following orders”. 

Thieves especially take this code seriously. It is never okay to beguile people maliciously, only when you openly admit that you would such a thing or having a previously declared reason to do it (e.g. gold). Dirty blows are allowed, but only when you declare so. If your partner says he does the job for the gold, don’t be too surprised if he rats you out for more money. But if he doesn’t, well you might be able to get the Thieves guild involved.  

## Domain of dagger
Also known as **Church of Thieves**. Farnah is, unsurprisingly, patron of thieves and assassins. Farnah was the first criminal in the Datara’s city. He caused mischief ever since there was a notion of law. Many joke that Farnah Is the reason Datara invented laws. Anyway, he claimed he did his petty thefts for gold, and he was not lying, but there was a different aspect. He enjoyed the thrill of it, the wild chases across the town, the skirmishes with Datara himself. Criminals are romanticised a bit in these lands… for many Nomads it is almost a sport or a game.

Those who devote themselves to this domain don’t see theft as a means to an end. It is the end. They attempt daring heists or perform dangerous maneuvers, hoping the Farnah will bless them with luck and fortune.

## Domain of coats
Also known as **Turncoat’s domain**. Farnah was no saint, quite the opposite. He had many enemies, some of which wished him dead. Farnah would rarely put his life on the line if he could help it, and so he joined forces with Laumor. Farnah lured out a garrison that was pursuing him into the wilderness, where Laumor’s beast killed them all. But he also betrayed Laumor, when learned his colleagues were about to assassinate Laumor. This was the lesson he learned from Laumor – do not fight the battles you don’t need to. If the flow of history dictates a change of allegiance, there is no shame in following it.

Nomads are big on this aspect. A cornered creature – be it beast, human or other folk, it will do whatever it needs to survive. None should be blamed for following that instinct. Self-preservation is paramount. At every cost.
  
### Improvise, adapt, overcome & the everyday-man
Farnah’s legends are one of the most engaging in Nomad mythos, maybe even any mythos. Farnah always makes best of what cards he has, constantly improvising, adapting, and finding new ways to get out of sticky situations. He couldn’t take the problems head-on as his other colleagues could. He could not break through walls with supernatural might of Groker, unstoppable zeal of Datara or unrivalled mind of Oxartes. But he never needed to – he always found a way around. He was the everyday man in the stories of heroes and yet, he still managed to come up on top.  

## Domains & Symbol
Wooden coin.    

# Freni, Stories told by merry folk
Freni is Datara’s wife, a beautiful, kind but sorrowful lady. Her origins are unclear, but most sources claim she is the daughter of Laumor, and it is only thanks to her that the little bits of nature that remained did not wither away.

Although being the least powerful of the Nomad pantheon, she is the second most popular (second only to Farnah). While it may seem surprising at first, it shouldn’t be! She is a patron to many domains and is appealing to folks of many different stripes.  

## Domain of Regrets
Freni was the only one who never agreed to murdering Laumor. Whether it was her gentle nature, or simply did not want to kill her father is up to many debates among historians. In the aftermath that followed, she questioned Datara’s judgement, her allegiances and whether what happened was a good thing. She often went out and tended to whatever gardens remained int the city. Rumours say that after she ascended to godhood, she looks after the oases and sees that the nature will never truly die completely.

Freni learned that it is important to reflect on what happened – for better or worse. To be grateful for what you have and regret what you did wrong. It allows you to appreciate what comes next and avoid making the same mistakes over and over. Nomads can excuse an honest mistake. But making it twice is less… excusable.  

## Domain of Tears
Having lost her father (supposedly), her gardens, her world Freni is no stranger to grief. She is a patron of bereaved and those cursed with fear, sadness, and dread.

### Melancholy
Nomads believe that a healthy mind is a balanced one. Those who are constantly happy will crash thoroughly and crack when the test comes. Those always calm will explode with anger at some point. It is important to have balance in your emotions. In particular, it is important, from time to time, to allow yourself to be sad. To pause and ponder for a moment.  

### Respect for the dead
Nomads may seem disrespectful to many other cultures, when its anything but! Often, people hold celebrations in the names of the deceased rather than proper rites of passage, to commemorate them and to ease of the grief and loss for those left behind. Freni reminds those who grief that the life goes on – the world is still there. It will not wait for you. Those celebrations serve to remind folks of that.  

### The good AND the bad
Nomads believe that the good does not always cancel out the bad, and that bad does not always cancel out the good. For better or worse. One can be happy and sad at the same time. It is a lesson Freni learned when she traveled to other oases with Oxartes.  

## Domain of Songs
Freni was beautiful and so was her voice. Soothing, calming, and pleasant her voice possessed almost supernatural abilities. Her voice could conjure up tears, make people laugh, bring stories to life or calm a raging soul. 
 
### Storytellers
Freni was a good storyteller and is a patron of bards and traveling minstrels. Nomad stories are one of the most well-crafted stories in Laurasia. While Galicians tend to exaggerate to impress the listener, Nomad rely on speech-craft and playing with words to precision-support the themes of the story. They use humor, dread, and drama so skillfully that they can make your usual grocery run sound like a knightly epic. 

Nomads appreciate good story and good story-tellers. Minstrels, bards, writers, and actors are respected professions, though only a few have what it takes to become one.  

### Celebrations
There should always be a moment and place for cheerful tune. A moment of respite, regardless of how desperate the situation is. Sometimes it may be difficult to find time, willpower, or taste for such a thing. But it is important – for too much sadness, grief or dread is a hefty curse. It is one that Freni understands, though, and even she knows the importance of allowing oneself to be happy from time to time. But she also knows, that is a tall order for some, and so she guides those to the light and cheer.
  
## Domain of Curses & Love
Freni met Datara when he was attacked by a hog in the wilderness. She saved him, healed his wounds, and calmed the hog. That is when Datara fell in love with her, and she with him. They talked for a long time, about hogs, cities, laws and, among other things Laumor.

Freni and Datara never really agreed when it came to Laumor. But they loved each other, and that was enough for her to let it slide. Maybe it was foolish, maybe it was wrong, but if Freni could go back in time, she would marry Datara again. She would allow him to kill Laumor.

That is the lesson Freni teaches – a lesson of love and loss. She claims that sometimes, love is worth more than anything else to you. But she also warns, that in doing so, you might lose more than you would want. Ultimately, loving and being loved is a blessing and a curse, a gambit with fate.  

### Healing
Freni, among many other things, is also a patron to healers. Nomad rarely believe that time will help things, but acting rashly helps even more rarely. Healing is a slow process, but it is a process that must be done consciously and deliberately. Time itself is not enough. That is true of all injuries, though the scope is different for each one. Wounds of soul heal slower than wounds of flesh. But much like flesh wounds – if left untreated, you will bleed out or get infected. 
 
## Domains & Symbol
Piece of limestone, usually in shape of a heart.
