# The Unburied
**Undead of Galicia**

Nobody quite knows what happened that day in Bistont. It was a regular, sunny evening like any other. That, however, changed quickly as everyone unfortunate enough to find themselves in Apulia that day was turned undead.

As if that was not enough, the undead activity in the Duchy went through the roof. Monsters were witnessed just appearing randomly in the woods. Villages pillaged by shadowy figures. The land was in chaos. For a while at least.

But life moved on. Being un-dead cannot possibly stop the ever-cheerful [[Galicians|Republic of Galicia]]. Many undead retained their personalities, though some were driven insane by the very fact. There were a lot of deaths and damage and the region is still recovering from the sudden barrage of horror that raced through the duchy.  


## Instability
The [[Duke|Galician noble titles#duke]] is now undead and is now known as *The Dead Duke*. However, he was stripped of his title. The original Marquess and most of the Council of that time were killed in the events that followed, and the land was slow to organize. In fact, many of the villages and cities are still rebuilding and the whole region is still recovering.

There has been no new duke since, though recently a new vice-duke was appointed.  

## Hope
Adversity can forge cowards and heroes alike. This is, in fact, the story of the Count of Zolaacia, who saved the Archduke at the time.
Some of the nobility were upset by the fact this fellow is, in fact, a kobold. However, the Count quickly became a local hero after helping locals fending of the waves of undead. He became the light - the hope the peasants needed to carry them through these times of trying.

## Difficult predicament
Now with the population of Apulia turned undead but still mostly sapient - almost humans. Galicia has little choice, but to tolerate these people. Some are even quite noble of birth, which introduced further tensions among the noble circles.

Galicians call these *people* the **Unburied**. They are free to roam the country and are citizens in their full right. They might make some people around them uneasy, sure, but they are allowed here in Galicia...  

## Mystery
Little is known about what happened, and there is a lot of unanswered questions. Some say the first-dame is responsible, some blame the duke... there are some who believe this just another [[elven|Elven kingdom]] plot.

But there are more questions beyond "whom to blame". For example, [[The Inquisition]] has never actually sent in an Inquisitor, but why? First-dame was sending troops, merchants and basically everyone out of the city - anyone who would listen. But if she knew in advance, why would she stay? Or why was this confined to Bistont? How did the curse know to stop just at the borders of the Duchy?

We could go on and on... there is a lot we do not yet know.
