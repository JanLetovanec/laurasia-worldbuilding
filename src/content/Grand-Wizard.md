Grand Wizard degree can only be obtained at Highest University of Acaadia. Not only that, but they can only be awarded to arcanic fields, natural philosophy and cognitive philosophy (physics & maths) These are the possible classes:
   * Grand Abjurer
   * Grand Conjurer
   * Grand Diviner
   * Grand Enchanter
   * Grand Invoker
   * Grand Illusionist
   * Grand Necromancer
   * Grand Transmuter
   * Grand Master
   * Grand Philosopher

As you can see, most of the classes correspond to a given school of magic, with notable expection of Lore master, which is something between the jack-of all trades and catch-all category. It focuses mostly on theory of magic itself, rather than on the particular school.

The only non-magical degree in this category is **Grand Philosopher**, which focuses on *Natural philosophy* (physics & maths).

In addition, there is always only a single living person (in each class) that is awarded the degree. These 10 Grand wizards can almost always be found on the university ground. Although in rare cases, they may be conducting research in the field, as that is usually delegated to lesser degrees.
They are the apex of Academic hierarchy.

## Requirements

* be a [[post-Dragonlight|Dragonlight]]
* be an active member of academic community
* conduct a well-recognized and novel research
* have your respective branch nominate you
* have all active Grand wizards vote on you admission
* there is no living Grand wizard for your branch

## Appointment
You will be summoned to the Great University Hall, usually reserved for ceremonies, but this time, this enormous hall will be empty, apart from the all living Grand Wizards.

**Lord prefect-legate** will have a speech if they are alive, otherwise, the **Grand Wizards** will have a joint speech.

Finally they will proclaim you a Grand Wizard for life.

## Duties
Grand wizard brings more duties than benefits.

You run the administrative task of your respective department. If there are conflicts for choosing **Biviligators** or juries, you are to resolve them.

Finally, you function as the defence department of the University. You are sworn to protect the sacred academic ground with your life, and you shall protect the sovereignty of the University to the best of your ability. During a siege of the university you are the generals, the front line, the strategists... students and other staff can join if they want,  but symbolically, you are there to protect them (not vice versa!).

## Benefits
The most obvious benefit is fame and respect.

There are also other benefits - you can oversee any operation in your respective branch, and you can request an action in any other branch. Lesser branches, that have no Grand Wizard are considered to be under all Grand Wizards.

Additionally, you can veto any disgrace vote if you find it fit, although, this happened only on 3 occasions, all of which were edge cases, and the subject was actually proven innocent. People this high do not abuse their power.

Some jokingly say, that you will get paid, get free food and free bed for not doing that much. Although it is true that the university will take care of you, you are by no means *not doing that much*.

## Accoutrements & Equipment

* Decree of Grant Wizardry
* Academic gown
* Ashes of your [[Magelight]] and [[Dragonlight]] hats (if they were available)
* Grand hat
* Grant wizard quarters

## Grounds for Removal/Dismissal
Unlike any other degree, you will be stripped of this degree on your death. This is mostly due to a singular case, where they once revived a former Grand Necromancer, and then there were 2 Grand Necromancer. This got quickly resolved, and this new rule was put in place.

Formally, you can still be disgraced after death, although there is no recorded instance of such event.
