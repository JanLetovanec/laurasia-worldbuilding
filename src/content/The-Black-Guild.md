#The Black Guild

Originally, *The Black Guild* was an ordinary thieves guild equivalent in [[Bryten|Bryten Kingdom]]. However, due to it's disorganized nature and Bytren's attitude to criminals, it declined in both popularity and influence. Compounded by the fact that it could not fulfill any niche that is not already satisfied by other groups of interest, things looked fairly dark for Black guild.

Eventually, Black guild adapted and became what we know colloquially as **Pirates**. They control overwhelming majority of naval crimes and thus allowed it to remain relevant in the *Great game* for power, influence and infamy.

## Specialty
Black guild control most of the illegal trade. They specialize in smuggling and trading goods of legally dubious nature. As a result, they control the **Black market** (which is where it gets its name from). Chances are, if it exists, they sell it. Nothing is too precious... provided enough gold, of course.
